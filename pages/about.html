            Prior to founding Socious Inc. I founded Discover Deep Japan Inc. in 2019 with a mission to build a more inclusive world. The biggest challenge I faced as a social entrepreneur is to secure the human and financial resources needed to realize our mission. 
            <br><br>
            Unlike traditional businesses, social businesses need to collaborate with impact investors and hire employees who are passionate about the company’s mission. However, existing products like LinkedIn focuses on connecting people through skills and experience and cannot connect like-minded people through social passions. The resources to achieve the SDGs are not united because people try to solve the same social issue cannot easily collaborate with each other.

          <p>Before becoming a social entrepreneur, I worked in the international humanitarian sector for about five years, working for international organizations such as the UNHCR and the ICRC. While it was an amazing experience and fulfilling work, my potential can be maximized by working in a small team as a social entrepreneur rather than working for big organizations like the UN and the Red Cross. However, many people who are passionate about realizing the SDGs are not in an environment where they can maximize their potential.</p>

          <p>The social sector workforce makes up on average 7.4 percent of the total workforce. The more people are involved in the social sector, the faster we can solve social issues.

            <p>
              I founded Discover Deep Japan Inc. in 2019, a social business that aims to create a multicultural society, before I founded Socious Corporation. The biggest challenge I faced as a social entrepreneur was securing the human resources and funds necessary to solve social issues. Social business is different from ordinary business in that it requires co-creation and collaboration with people and investors who share the same mission, but existing products such as LinkedIn can provide connections in terms of skills and experience, but cannot provide encounters with like-minded people. Since people who aim to solve the same social issues cannot join forces, resources for achieving the SDGs will be dispersed.

              Before I became a social entrepreneur, I worked for about five years in international humanitarian assistance at UNHCR and ICRC. It was very meaningful work and a valuable experience, but as a social entrepreneur, I can maximize my potential and create a greater social impact in a small organization rather than contributing to solving social issues as a member of a huge organization like the UN or Red Cross. However, many of the people involved in achieving the SDGs are not in an environment where they can maximize their potential.

              Data shows that people like us who are fully committed to solving social issues account for about 7.4% of the working population, but if more people get involved in achieving the SDGs in various ways such as side jobs, pro bono work, and volunteering, social change will be accelerated. However, even if they are interested, it is difficult for them to participate in activities related to the SDGs.
